            <h2> Research Poster Re-Design </h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> Winter 2020</p>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> 24" x 8"</p>
            <p><strong>Software Used:</strong> Adobe InDesign</p>
            <p> This poster was designed to update the current research 
                posters inside the engineering buildings at the University 
                of Waterloo. This poster was built using Adobe InDesign.   </p>
            <p>My supervisor challenged me with this project to create a poster that demonstrates 
                a ‘timeless’ design – and this was the final design. National Geographic and 
                Foundations by Noriko Maeda, a Japanese calligraphy book, inspired this poster.</p>
            <p>I began studying Noriko Maeda’s book to get a sense of an idea of how Japanese 
                calligraphy art creates a timeless look. I learned that with Noriko Maeda’s 
                calligraphy, the asymmetry of the calligraphy and the addition of a small 
                bright red signature stamp creates a balanced and timeless effect. I also 
                discovered that the calligraphy Noriko creates looks at sight, language, 
                and time. Furthermore, I also studied National Geographic’s magazine issues 
                to figure out how they created a timeless design that people love and recognize. 
                National Geographic is not only known for its magazine content but as well as their 
                signature yellow border. National Geographic’s yellow border is a great example that 
                demonstrates how simple branding can be tied to a product or message. With these two books 
                in mind, I began to create my version of a timeless design focusing on simplicity, asymmetry 
                but with balance and typography.</p>
            <p>During my recent co-op term at the University of Waterloo, I worked on this project from 
                start to finish and led the redesign. I also created a different set of poster designs 
                for this project. These posters have a more modern look that doesn't focus as much on 
                the concept of a 'timeless' design. You can find them down below.</p>

            <h2>Countdown for StarterHacks 2020</h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> Fall 2019</p>
            <p><strong>Software Used:</strong> Figma</p>
            <p>These graphics were created for the Starterhacks 
                upcoming deadline posts back in December for StarterHacks 
                2020 applications. Each piece was designed to show the 
                number of days leading to the last day of applying to the 
                StarterHacks 2020 hackathon. The theme of this year's StarterHacks 
                was adventure and travel.</p>
            <p>The concept behind these graphics was that I wanted to use our design 
                assets to tell a story that incorporates this year's theme into the designs. The designs 
                I created used symbolism through the use of a flying paper plane. 
                There is a paper plane flying across each design, and in the first 
                post, this is where the plane begins to fly. This first post, with 
                the airplane beginning its flight, represents the start of the final 
                days until applications close. Throughout multiple posts, the plane 
                continues to fly until the last post. When the plane begins to end 
                its flight, it symbolizes the day that applications closed.</p>
            <p>The colour choices used were taken from Starter Hacks' brand colours. 
                The colours are vibrant and recognizable to students who have heard or 
                know about StarterHacks.</p>

                        This poster was shared on both society's Instagram page

                    <p> ARBUS Society, in partnership with the Living Learning 
                        Community on campus, hosted an ‘ARBUS Opportunities Night’ 
                        for first-year Arts and Business students. As a Marketing 
                        and Graphics Coordinator, I was in charge of creating the 
                        poster for the event, and this was how it turned out. The 
                        design is straightforward, yet the message is clear. This 
                        poster was shared on the ARBUS Society's Instagram page and 
                        was seen by over 400 Instagram followers. Furthermore, this 
                        poster was printed and posted all over 6 Waterloo Residences. 
                        It was also mass emailed by the first-year Arts and Business advisor 
                        to ALL first-year Arts and Business students.</p>
