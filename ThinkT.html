            <h2><strong>Thinktum Mural (on hold)</strong></h2>
            <p><strong>Duration:</strong> Jan 2020 - Present </p>
            <p><strong>Size:</strong> 24' x 8'</p>
            <p><strong>Software Used:</strong> Figma, Procreate</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> This mural was a design that a close friend and I developed 
                over the past few months for Thinktum Inc., an innovative company 
                based in Waterloo. At the beginning of January 2020, we were approached 
                by Thinktum Inc. to design a mural for their office. We visited their 
                office multiple times to discuss ideas and expectations with the co-founders 
                about what they envisioned their mural to represent. We were faced with the 
                challenge of creating a mural that exemplifies Thinktumâ€™s values that they 
                stood for in a physical space. The Co-Founders wanted a mural designed to 
                represent the company, what they stood for, and a design that showcased 
                the atmosphere of the company.</p>

            <h3> The Design Process</h3>
            <p>Over the course of a few months, we visited Thinktum's office several times 
                to discuss ideas with the employees and the Co-Founders. While we were at the 
                office, we were able to see the wall where the mural will be painted, and we 
                were able to take notes about the interior of the office. After having discussions 
                with the Co-Founders about the company's values and vision for this mural, we started 
                brainstorming for ideas.</p>
            <p>We came up with two designs that we felt represented all their values and personality well. 
                The Co-Founders and employees loved both designs but couldn't decide which design they wanted 
                to move forward with. A solution that we suggested was that we could combine both designs 
                into one cohesive mural, with both aspects of the two designs included. We wanted to incorporate 
                the colours that were on the floors at the office onto our design, and ultimately, that is how our 
                current design came to be. We felt that having these colours could unify the mural and the interior 
                of the office.</p>

                <h3>Next Steps</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Finish finalizing the design and make sure that the owner and the employees 
                        are happy with everything on our design. </li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Unfortunately, this project is on hold due to Covid-19. 
                    We were nearing the finalization of the design before Covid-19.</strong></p>
