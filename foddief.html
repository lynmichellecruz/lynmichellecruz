            <h2> Foodie Venture </h2>
            <p><strong>Date:</strong> Fall 2019</p>
            <p><strong>Software Used:</strong> Adobe XD</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p> Foodie Venture was a project that I developed for 
                my Fine 229 class: Hybrid Digital Media. As a class, 
                we created a persona for a Waterloo student, and based 
                on the persona we made; we had to develop an app for that student. </p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>As a student myself, I thought about the types of problems that I faced 
                while being a Waterloo student. One day I was walking to the library 
                after class, and I got hungry. I couldn't decide what to eat. The 
                problem was that I had no idea what some of the stores on campus 
                had on their menusâ€”not knowing what type of food was being sold 
                made it more difficult for me to decide what I wanted to eat and where. 
                With this problem in mind, i chose to create an app that I felt could 
                help other students who may experience the same problem. </p>

            <h3>User Research</h3>
            <p>To find the best solution, and provide the best experience 
                for the end-users for this product, I created individual user personas for 
                different levels of students, first-year to fourth-year students.</p>

    
            <h3>My Goals</h3>
            <p>After having done my research, I created some goals that I hoped to establish with my design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Easy navigation</li>
                <li>Allow Users not to think</li>
                <li>Easy to get the Information</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>The Design Process</h3>
            <p>Before starting the digital wireframes, I began my design using paper and pen. 
                Starting with pen and paper was an important step because I needed to design 
                the overall flow and design of the app before moving onto the digital wireframes. 
                I decided to go with a design where the user can scroll and select the choice of 
                food, and it would say where the user can purchase it on campus.</p>

            <h3>App Branding</h3>
            <p>I chose the colour blue as the primary base because the colour 
                blue represents reliability, and my product is a reliable source 
                when it comes to finding a place to buy food on campus. I used 
                yellow as a secondary colour because it represents happiness and 
                to me, food brings me happiness, that's why I chose yellow. </p>
